#### 1.Implament API into Blackjack
##### I will be making a very simple blackjack game Using just a few calls to the DeckofCards API.
##### It is a basic API and should be relatively easy to access. Using my word Doc from before I will basically just write the code as I normally would, but with inputs just get it all from the API
