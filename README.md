# BlackJack
BlackJack using Deck of Cards API


## Issues
## 1. Figure out how to comment in GitHub
#### ----ACTUAL ISSUES-----
#### 1. Implement API into Blackjack
##### - I will be making a very simple blackjack game Using just a few calls to the DeckofCards API. It is a basic API and should be relatively easy to access. Using my word Doc from before I will basically just write the code as I normally would, but with inputs just get it all from the API
#### 2. I will likely Code within VS and then move it over here chunk by chunk as I have no Idea how to use GitHub at all
#### 3. Looking up in some documentation I need the returns import which I can get through pip
#### 4. I need to make various Functions for comparing Cards, Replayablility, and Turns then put them all in like a main bit
#### 5. The way I have it set up as of 10/13 7:39 I dont think it will be a back and forth, it will be the User deciding if they are content or not then the dealer getting to where it needs to be. Might be able to adjust later.
#### 6. I doubt #5 will be implemented, I have to move the calls into the main function and put it all together now.
