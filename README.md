# BlackJack
BlackJack using Deck of Cards API


## Issues
## 1. Figure out how to comment in GitHub
#### ----ACTUAL ISSUES-----
#### 1. Implement API into Blackjack
##### - I will be making a very simple blackjack game Using just a few calls to the DeckofCards API. It is a basic API and should be relatively easy to access. Using my word Doc from before I will basically just write the code as I normally would, but with inputs just get it all from the API
#### 2. I will likely Code within VS and then move it over here chunk by chunk as I have no Idea how to use GitHub at all
#### 3. Looking up in some documentation I need the returns import which I can get through pip
